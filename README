   a Regular Expression "wizard", all written with bash2 builtins

^txt2regex$ is a Regular Expression "wizard", all written with bash2
builtins, that converts human sentences to RegExs. with a simple
interface, you just answer to questions and build your own RegEx for a
large variety of programs, like awk, emacs, grep, perl, php, procmail,
python, sed and vim. there are more than 20 supported programs.
it's bash so download and run, no compilation needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY?
- to try to make simple RegExs less painful for the beginners
- to have a reliable source for RegExs differences between programs
- to have coding fun &:)


WHY BASH2?
basically, for me to learn the new bash2 concepts as arrays, i18n and
advanced variable expansion. they rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALL AND RUN

after expand the tarball, do you can simply run the program directly.
but if do you want it on your system, or in other language besides
english (portuguese & indonesian translations available), use `make`.

summary:
just english -> untar and run
with i18n    -> untar, make install and run


untar:
    tar xvzf txt2regex-0.2.tgz
    cd txt2regex-0.2

run:
    ./txt2regex.sh

make install:
  if you're root and wants to install it on the system, with i18n:

    make install
    /usr/bin/txt2regex

  or, if do you want to use it on locally, on the txt2regex dir, with
  i18n:

    make install BINDIR=. LOCALEDIR=po
    ./txt2regex


if you want to install it on another location, redefine BINDIR,
LOCATEDIR and DESTDIR variables.


gotcha:
the program do use the bash environment variable $LINES to get the
number of lines available, it *MUST* to be an exported variable, or
you'll be stucked at the default 24 lines limit.

try the command: /bin/bash -c 'echo $LINES'

if you don't get the number of lines, append "export LINES" at your
~/.bash_profile


----------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO USE IT?

first of all, accept the truth:
only works in bash >= 2.04
only works in bash >= 2.04
only works in bash >= 2.04


just run it and see the it's face.
the interface is pretty easy to understand, but in short, it's:

    +---------------------------------------+
    | -> top menu                 -> legend |
    |                                       |
    | -> RegExs of the programs selected    |
    |    ...                                |
    |    ...                                |
    |                                       |
    | -> history                            |
    | -> your prompt                        |
    |                                       |
    | -> the question                       |
    | -> the answers                        |
    |    ...                                |
    |    ...                                |
    +---------------------------------------+

so, using the numeric pad on the keyboard (there, on the right side),
press the numbers to choose the answers (turn NumLock on!) and just
see the RegExs being made.

as the top menu says, press `.` to quit and `0` (zero) to reset the
RegEx. the `*` key toggles color ON/OFF and `/` add/remove programs
on the RegEx part. just it.

so, in short:
- read the question
- choose the answer
- press the number
- fun!

  COMMAND LINE

there's a few command line options, see the --help:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                      |
|  usage: txt2regex [--history <value>] [--nocolor|--whitebg|--all]    |
|                                                                      |
|  OPTIONS (they are default OFF):                                     |
|                                                                      |
|    --all              works with all registered programs             |
|    --nocolor          self-explanatory                               |
|    --whitebg          colors adjusted to white background terminals  |
|    --history <value>  prints to STDOUT a RegEx from a history data   |
|                                                                      |
|  for more details about the options, read the README file.           |
|                                                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+


and as we're on the README file, here are the details:

* --all is cool but requires lots of lines (~35)
* --nocolor is strong, so it kills --whitebg
* --whitebg is a requirement of X users, and as i don't use X, tell me
    if anything is wrong
* --history is not very usefull now, but it will


and now what you've waiting for, the examples:

* a VERY VERY VERY simple ER to match an email@like-this.com
    txt2regex --all --history "2542154¤ @¤@¤ @"

* calling the program on a white terminal
    txt2regex --whitebg


----------------------------------------------------------------------

INFO ABOUT THE INFO ON IT

all RegExs and rules the program knows about were taken
- from the programs man pages
- or missing it, from the "mastering regular expressions" o'reilly book
- or missing it, from internet documents (oh no!)
- or missing it, guessing and testing...

of course, all info tested by hand, to be *really* reliable.

versions tested:
  ed: GNU ed version 0.2
  mawk: mawk 1.3.3 Nov 1996
  gawk: GNU Awk 3.0.6
  grep: grep (GNU grep) 2.4.2
  egrep: egrep (GNU grep) 2.4.2
  find: GNU find version 4.1
  javascript: netscape-4.77
  perl: v5.6.0 built for i386-linux
  php: 4.0.6
  postgres: psql (PostgreSQL) 7.1.2
  procmail: procmail v3.15.1 2001/01/08
  sed: GNU sed version 3.02.80
  tcl: 8.3
  vim: VIM - Vi IMproved 5.8 (2001 May 31)

gotcha:
  inside lists [], the "<TAB>" string represents a literal TAB, for
  programs wich doesn't support [\t].
