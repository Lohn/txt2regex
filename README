                          ^ txt2regexp.sh $

   a Regular Expression "wizard", all written with bash2 builtins

^txt2regexp.sh$ is a Regular Expression "wizard", all written with
bash2 builtins, that converts human sentences to RegExps. with a
simple interface, you just answer to questions and build your own
RegExp for a large variety of programs, like awk, ed, emacs, grep,
perl, php, python, sed, tcl and vim. there are 18 supported programs
now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY?
- to try to make simple RegExps less painful for the beginners
- to have a reliable source for RegExps differences between programs
- to have coding fun &:)


WHY BASH2?
basically, for me to learn the new bash2 concepts as arrays, i18n and
advanced variable expansion. they rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALL AND RUN

after expand the tarball, do you can simply run the program directly.
but if do you want it on your system, or in other language besides
english (only portuguese translation available now), use `make`.

summary:
just english -> untar and run
with i18n    -> untar, make install and run


untar:
    tar xvzf txt2regexp-0.1.tgz
    cd txt2regexp-0.1

run:
    ./txt2regexp.sh

make install:
  if you're root and wants to install it on the system, with i18n:

    make install
    /usr/bin/txt2regexp

  or, if do you want to use it on locally, on the txt2regexp dir, with
  i18n:

	make install BINDIR=. LOCALEDIR=po
    ./txt2regexp


if you want to install it on another location, redefine BINDIR,
LOCATEDIR and DESTDIR variables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO USE IT?

first of all, accept the truth:
only works in bash >= 2.04
only works in bash >= 2.04
only works in bash >= 2.04


just run it and see the it's face.
the interface is pretty easy to understand, but in short, it's:

    +---------------------------------------+
    | -> top menu                 -> legend |
    |                                       |
    | -> RegExps of the programs selected   |
    |    ...                                |
    |    ...                                |
    |                                       |
    | -> history                            |
    | -> your prompt                        |
    |                                       |
    | -> the question                       |
    | -> the answers                        |
    |    ...                                |
    |    ...                                |
    +---------------------------------------+

so, using the numeric pad on the keyboard (there, on the right side),
press the numbers to choose the answers (turn NumLock on!) and just
see the RegExps being made.

as the top menu says, press `.` to quit and `0` (zero) to reset the
RegExp. the `*` key toggles color ON/OFF and `/` add/remove programs
on the RegExp part. just it.

so, read the question (in yellow), choose the answer, and press its
number.

INFO ABOUT THE INFO ON IT

all RegExps and rules the program knows about were taken
- from the programs man pages
- or missing it, from the "mastering regular expressions" o'relly book
- or missing it, from internet documents (oh no!)
- or missing it, guessing and testing...


of course, all info tested by hand, to the *really* reliable..

versions tested:
  ed: GNU ed version 0.2
