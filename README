                          ^ txt2regex.sh $

   a Regular Expression "wizard", all written with bash2 builtins

^txt2regex$ is a Regular Expression "wizard", all written with bash2
builtins, that converts human sentences to RegExs. with a simple
interface, you just answer to questions and build your own RegEx for a
large variety of programs, like awk, ed, emacs, grep, perl, php,
python, sed, tcl and vim. there are 18 supported programs now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY?
- to try to make simple RegExs less painful for the beginners
- to have a reliable source for RegExs differences between programs
- to have coding fun &:)


WHY BASH2?
basically, for me to learn the new bash2 concepts as arrays, i18n and
advanced variable expansion. they rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALL AND RUN

after expand the tarball, do you can simply run the program directly.
but if do you want it on your system, or in other language besides
english (portuguese & indonesian translations available), use `make`.

summary:
just english -> untar and run
with i18n    -> untar, make install and run


untar:
    tar xvzf txt2regex-0.2.tgz
    cd txt2regex-0.2

run:
    ./txt2regex.sh

make install:
  if you're root and wants to install it on the system, with i18n:

    make install
    /usr/bin/txt2regex

  or, if do you want to use it on locally, on the txt2regex dir, with
  i18n:

    make install BINDIR=. LOCALEDIR=po
    ./txt2regex


if you want to install it on another location, redefine BINDIR,
LOCATEDIR and DESTDIR variables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO USE IT?

first of all, accept the truth:
only works in bash >= 2.04
only works in bash >= 2.04
only works in bash >= 2.04


just run it and see the it's face.
the interface is pretty easy to understand, but in short, it's:

    +---------------------------------------+
    | -> top menu                 -> legend |
    |                                       |
    | -> RegExs of the programs selected    |
    |    ...                                |
    |    ...                                |
    |                                       |
    | -> history                            |
    | -> your prompt                        |
    |                                       |
    | -> the question                       |
    | -> the answers                        |
    |    ...                                |
    |    ...                                |
    +---------------------------------------+

so, using the numeric pad on the keyboard (there, on the right side),
press the numbers to choose the answers (turn NumLock on!) and just
see the RegExs being made.

as the top menu says, press `.` to quit and `0` (zero) to reset the
RegEx. the `*` key toggles color ON/OFF and `/` add/remove programs
on the RegEx part. just it.

so, read the question (in yellow), choose the answer, and press its
number.
             _______________________________________

  COMMAND LINE

there's a few command line options


usage: txt2regex [--history <value>] [--nocolor|--all]


  --all       works with all registered programs
  --nocolor   self-explanatory
  --history   prints on STDOUT a RegEx from a history data
              (no interative, implicit --nocolor)

a history data are those things inside the "clouds"
.oO(...)(...), being .oO(history)(¤user_input1¤userinput2¤...)

example:

    txt2regex --all --history 2155115¤2¤:¤2

to obtain a (very) simple ER to match hour on the hh:mm format.
not very usefull now, but it will.

INFO ABOUT THE INFO ON IT

all RegExs and rules the program knows about were taken
- from the programs man pages
- or missing it, from the "mastering regular expressions" o'reilly book
- or missing it, from internet documents (oh no!)
- or missing it, guessing and testing...

of course, all info tested by hand, to the *really* reliable..

versions tested:
  ed: GNU ed version 0.2
  egrep: egrep (GNU grep) 2.4.2
  find: GNU find version 4.1

yes, it's GPL.

BUGS, IMPROVEMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

they're VERY welcome! send to the author (e-mail below).

a cool (and easy/fast to do) contribution is a translation of the
program messages to your own language. get the po/pt_BR.po file as an
example and translate it. in doubt, ask.
