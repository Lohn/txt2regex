Txt2regex is a regular expression wizard that converts human sentences
to regexes. In a simple interactive console interface, the user answer
questions and the program builds the regexes for more than 20 programs
like grep, Vim, Emacs, JavaScript, PHP, Python, PostgreSQL. It is a
Shell Script 100% written with Bash builtin commands. No compilation or
extra commands are needed, just download it and run.

See [tests/cmdline.md](tests/cmdline.md) for a complete list of all the
available command line options and examples on using them.


## Install and run

Txt2regex is a stand-alone Bash script, it doesn't need to be installed.
Just run it:

    bash txt2regex.sh

Making it an executable file, you can run it directly:

    chmod +x txt2regex.sh
    ./txt2regex.sh

If you want it in another language besides English, use the `make`
command to properly install it in your system:

    make install BINDIR=. LOCALEDIR=po
    ./txt2regex

> Play with `BINDIR`, `LOCALEDIR` and `DESTDIR` variables to change the
default install paths.


## Regex tester to gather "real life" data

Txt2regex needs to know regex-related information for each program it
supports. For example:

- which metacharacters are supported?
- how to escape a metacharacter to match it literally?
- are POSIX character classes supported?

Instead of relying in documentation to get that information, the
[tests/regex-tester.sh](tests/regex-tester.sh) script calls the real
programs with specially crafted regexes and sample texts, verifying how
those programs behave in "real life".

To have a trackable and public record, the output of this tester is also
saved to this repository, in a readable and grepable plain text file:
[tests/regex-tester.txt](tests/regex-tester.txt). Future changes in
behavior can be easily detected.

To translate txt2regex to your language:

- translate the [po/txt2regex.pot][potfile] file (in the `msgstr` lines)
- save it as `po/XX.po` (where XX is the [two-letter code][iso639] for
  your language)
- submit this new `.po` file in a pull request

Check the [current translations][pos] for reference.

## FAQ

### Why?

- To try to make simple regexes less painful for the beginners.
- To have a reliable source for regexes differences between programs.
- To have coding fun :)

### What is that `<TAB>` that appears in the regex?

That `<TAB>` represents a literal tab character. When using the regex in
the desired external program, remember to change that to a literal tab.
This is required by programs that do not support using `\t` as a
shortcut for the tab character.

### Why my terminal size (lines/columns) is not detected?

Txt2regex uses the environment variables `$LINES` and `$COLUMNS` to get
the current terminal size. Make sure you have them exported, otherwise
the default 80x25 size will be assumed.

To check if the variables are exported, run:

```bash
bash -c 'echo $COLUMNS $LINES'
```

If no numbers are shown in the output, a quick fix is running:

```bash
export COLUMNS LINES
```

As a permanent fix, add the previous `export` command to a Bash
configuration file, such as `~/.bashrc`.
